1. Quality of it's components (modules) and quality of their interactions. Good architecture and good algorithms.
2. Simplest component is a function.

```
Multiple alorithms can solve same problem.
An algorithms can be implemented in multiple ways (due to syntactic sugars [what kind of iteration, recursion] and complexity of idea represented in pseudocode or a step of algorithm)
Algorithms are programming language independent, they can be implemented in any programming language.
Code is for people as well. Clever code may become difficult to read back and update.
Don't lose sight of bigger picture, what indicator that algorithm should fulfill (readability, efficiency, scalability, security or something else)

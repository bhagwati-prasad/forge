- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem (or complete a task). Recipe analogy - Make something using these steps. It can be not-well defined if some instruction is out of lexical scope or not defined (hover 3 inch over air to make cake fluffy), or unending (lather-rinse-repeat in a huge tub of shampoo).
- It is a logical series of steps that computer takes to solve a problem. An algorithm takes in an input, processes it through sequence of logical operations, and produces an output.
```
- Every step must be *precise*, it should be unambiguous.
- Every algorithm must be *finite*. It should eventually stop at some point in future.
- An algorithm must be *correct*, it should provide a correct output for every valid input.
- An algorithm should have parameters for *efficiency*, how much memory and cpu time is consumed.
- *Implementation time* vs *Performance requirement*
```
- A pseudocode is written for an algorithm. Lego analogy - Using a set of given blocks, make a provided shape (tranlation or bridge between human language and code using computational thinking).

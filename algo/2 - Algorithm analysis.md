Asymptotic notation to analyse algorithm efficiency/performance. They are expressed in terms on input size only and are *independent of machine architecture* and the OS.
Sort of provides a bird's eye view or the bigger picture. They are not for distinguishing between similar performing algorithms.
```
Big O : Worst case complexity
Omega : Best case complexity
Theta : Average case complexity
